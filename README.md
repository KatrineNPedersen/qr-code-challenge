## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Flexbox was the biggest obstacle in this challenge, but learning the difference between the properties for the parent element and the child elements are definitly helping to grow my understanding of the concept.

### Continued development

I will also be continuing to focus on the flexbox concept in future projects until I feel totally comfortable using it.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox resource](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is a very comprehensive article which helped me finally understand flexbox. I'd recommend to anyone that is learning this concept to keep this overview close.
